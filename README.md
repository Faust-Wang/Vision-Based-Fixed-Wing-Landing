# Vision-Based-Fixed-Landing-

Autonomous landing has become a core technology of unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV) guidance, navigation and control system. Since a single GPS provide
position accuracy of at most a few meters, an airplane equipped with a single GPS
only is not guaranteed to land at a designated location with a sufficient accuracy.
Therefore, a vision based algorithm is proposed to improve the accuracy of
landing. In this scheme, the airplane is controlled to fly into the net by directly
feeding back the pitch and yaw deviation angles sensed by the camera mounted
on the ground near ground control station during the terminal landing phase. The
air craft is detected by using sliding window, features extraction, classification and
machine learning methods. The algorithms were tried on a real dataset that was
collected using a glider aircraft.
